# Kotak_Bank_management_system

Introduction 
        The Kotak Bank Database System is a robust and scalable MySQL-based database 
        designed to manage banking operations efficiently. It includes tables for customers, 
        accounts, branches, employees, transactions, and loans, enabling seamless data 
        management and analytics for a banking environment. 

Project Purpose 
        The purpose of this project is to: 
        1. Centralize Banking Data: Store and manage customer, account, and 
        transaction data in a structured manner. 
        2. Enable Analytics: Provide sample SQL queries for insights into customer 
        behavior, transaction trends, and loan approvals. 
        3. Ensure Scalability: Design a normalized database schema that can handle 
        future expansions. 

Features 
        1. Comprehensive Schema: 
            o 6+ tables: Customers, Accounts, Branches, Employees, Transactions, and Loans. 
            o Relationships between tables (e.g., customer-account, account-transaction). 
        2. Data Validation: 
            o Constraints (e.g., UNIQUE email, NOT NULL phone). 
            o Foreign keys for referential integrity. 
        3. Sample Queries: 
            o Retrieve customer transaction history. 
            o Calculate total deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. 
            o Analyze loan approvals and rejections. 
        4. Scalability: 
            o Modular design for adding new features (e.g., credit cards, investments).
